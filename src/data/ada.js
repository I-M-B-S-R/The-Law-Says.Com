    name: "Other Power Driven Mobility Devices (OPDMD)",
    // --- UPDATED TEXT WITH CITATIONS ---
    text: `The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) includes regulations for "Other Power-Driven Mobility Devices" (OPDMDs). An OPDMD is defined in the Department of Justice regulations (at **28 C.F.R. § 35.104** and **28 C.F.R. § 36.104**) as "any mobility device powered by batteries, fuel, or other engines… that is used by individuals with mobility disabilities for the purpose of locomotion… but that is not a wheelchair". Examples include golf cars, electronic personal assistance mobility devices (like Segways®), or devices designed for areas without defined pedestrian routes (like ATVs).

State and local governments (Title II, governed by **28 C.F.R. Part 35**) and places of public accommodation (Title III businesses, governed by **28 C.F.R. Part 36**) must permit individuals with mobility disabilities to use OPDMDs in areas open to pedestrian use, unless the entity can demonstrate that the specific class of OPDMD cannot be operated in accordance with legitimate safety requirements (**see 28 C.F.R. § 35.137(b)** for Title II and **28 C.F.R. § 36.311(b)** for Title III).

Entities must assess several factors when deciding whether a class of OPDMD can be accommodated safely (**see 28 C.F.R. § 35.137(b)(2)** and **28 C.F.R. § 36.311(b)(2)**):
1.  The type, size, weight, dimensions, and speed of the device.
2.  The volume of pedestrian traffic (which may vary).
3.  The facility’s design and operational characteristics (e.g., indoor/outdoor, square footage, obstacles).
4.  Whether legitimate safety requirements can be established (e.g., speed limits, restricted areas).
5.  Whether the use creates a substantial risk of serious harm to the environment or conflicts with federal land management laws.

Safety requirements must be based on actual risks, not on stereotypes or assumptions about the device or the user.

Entities may ask a person using an OPDMD to provide "credible assurance" that the device is required because of a disability (**see 28 C.F.R. § 35.137(c)** and **28 C.F.R. § 36.311(c)**). Acceptable credible assurance includes:
1.  A valid state-issued disability parking placard or card, or other state-issued proof of disability.
2.  A verbal statement from the user that the device is needed due to a mobility disability, unless contradicted by observable fact.

Entities cannot ask about the nature or extent of the person's disability.`
