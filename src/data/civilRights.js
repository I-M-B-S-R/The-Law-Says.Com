    text: `The Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Pub.L. 88–352, 78 Stat. 241) is a landmark civil rights and labor law in the United States that outlaws discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. It prohibits unequal application of voter registration requirements, racial segregation in schools, employment, and public accommodations.

Key provisions include:
- **Title I:** Addressed unequal application of voter registration requirements.

- **Title III:** Prohibited state and municipal governments from denying access to public facilities on grounds of race, color, religion or national origin.
- **Title IV:** Encouraged the desegregation of public schools and authorized the U.S. Attorney General to file suits to enforce said act.
- **Title VI:** Prevents discrimination by government agencies that receive federal funds. If an agency is found in violation of Title VI, that agency can lose its federal funding.
- **Title VII:** Prohibits discrimination by covered employers on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin. Also prohibits discrimination against an individual because of his or her association with another individual of a particular race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, such as by an interracial marriage. Title VII also created the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to implement the law.

    id: 2,
    name: "Voting Rights Act of 1965",
    text: `The Voting Rights Act of 1965 (Pub.L. 89–110, 79 Stat. 437) is a landmark piece of federal legislation in the United States that prohibits racial discrimination in voting. It was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson during the height of the Civil Rights Movement on August 6, 1965, and Congress later amended the Act five times to expand its protections.

Designed to enforce the voting rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, the Act secured voting rights for racial minorities throughout the country, especially in the South. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, the Act is considered to be the most effective piece of federal civil rights legislation ever enacted in the country.

Key provisions include:
- **Section 2:** Prohibits voting practices or procedures that discriminate on the basis of race, color, or membership in a language minority group. This applies nationwide.
- **Section 4(b):** Contained a formula to identify jurisdictions with a history of discrimination. These jurisdictions were subject to Section 5. (The Supreme Court struck down the coverage formula in Shelby County v. Holder (2013), rendering Section 5 ineffective unless Congress enacts a new formula).
- **Section 5:** Required certain jurisdictions identified under 4(b) ("covered jurisdictions") to obtain federal preclearance before implementing any changes to their voting laws or procedures.
- **Section 203:** Requires certain states and jurisdictions to provide language assistance to voters in communities where there is a concentration of citizens who are limited English proficient.
