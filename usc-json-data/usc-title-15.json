Such district court shall thereupon have jurisdiction to enter a decree affirming, modifying, or setting aside said order, or enter such other decree as the court may deem equitable, and may make rules as to pleadings and proceedings to be had in considering such order.

The court shall, upon conclusion of its hearing, enforce its decree by a permanent injunction or other appropriate remedy.
